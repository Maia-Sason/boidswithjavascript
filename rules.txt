Boids: Flocking simulation.

Boids have 3 crucial rules:

Separation:
  Steer to avoid crowding LOCAL flockmates

Alignment:
  Steer towards AVERAGE heading of LOCAL flockmates

Cohesion
  Steer to move toward position of LOCAL flockmates

Flocking requires that boids only react to flockmates within a certain small neighborhood around them
Neighborhood characterized by distance measured from center of boid and an angle measured frin boids
direction of flight
Flockmates outside neighborhood are ignored!
